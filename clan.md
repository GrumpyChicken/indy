# Ideas

## Forums
- could pull content from github for some of the info

### Useful sites and 3rd party apps
- Braytech
- DIM
- https://www.destiny2.science/

### Builds

### Dungeon Guides
- Possibly just start with images/maps of various encounters

### Raid Guides
- Possibly just start with images/maps of various encounters

## General

- Non-voicechat friendly
- Triumph club/hunters (role/tag)
- Timeboxers (role/tag)
  - Offer things like 1-2 hour blocks to work on a specific endgame activity,
    make it as far as time allows, continue next scheduled block

## Recruiting Goals/Clan Approach
- Mention items from 'General'
- Friendly to part-time guardians, no play requirements, or very loose, maybe
  something like 'let us know if you havent been active for quite a while, but
  still want to be in the clan'.
- explictly call out age flexibility - requirement is more 'be a nice person'.
  Something like "we welcome guardians of all ages, though we are predominantly
  adults. We have members ranging in age from early 20s to 'approaching
  retirement'". I often feel unsure when I see posts and the group sounds mostly
  like younger people, as I am not sure I will fit in.

## Discord
- Make server discoverable to bring in more new people
- Use/test 'Events' builtin scheduling, looks like you can do both start and end
  time, and seems more user-friendly than our old scheduling system. Icludes
  things like recurring events, which could be nice for things like weekly
  dungeons/raids, working through triumphs for a certain title, etc.
