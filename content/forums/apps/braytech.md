Braytech is a tool built by Tom Chapman, and has many useful
sections/information. Some of my favorites include:

**Triumphs**: this area lets you easily see what you have remaining for specific
triumphs you may be working on (both titles and individual triumphs). You can do
things like pin a title you are working on, so it is always at the top of the
list, making it easier to find and check on. There is a 'tracked' columns for
items you have chosen to track with the app, and another for things you are
'close to completing', whether they are tracked or not.

**Weeklies**: Quickly check on what is up currently in the rotation for featured
dungeons, raids, nightfalls, etc. Activities with modifiers show the modifier
right here, making it easy to know how to prepare appropriate gear. Also
sections for rotations (shows upcoming location and, where appropriate, reward
rotation), 'Activity Challenges' (powerful/pinnacle reward info), and 'Season
Challenges' (I find the most useful bit here is the ability to view all
uncompleted in one place instead of having to click through each week in game).

**Quests**: Everything you would find in the quests tab, including bounties, but
with additional information on each multi step quest. If you click on such a
quest, you can see what all the steps are you have completed, as well as what
steps are left.

There are numerous other sections, these are just a few I like to use frequently.
